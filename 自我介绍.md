# Self Introduction

I am going to introduce myself from 2 parts, The first part is my Campus life. My academic performance ranks in the top 11% overall, and I have won an excellent scholarship for two consecutive years. I learned netwoking, data structure, Database and so on. And I also took part in the student union work, very good at communicating with others.


The second part is about my intern experience. My main technology stack is java, I have strong code practice ability, and I have had two internship experiences. The first one is in Bytedance. Last winter, I did some backend development in Bytedance. I am responsible for the development of SaaS, which is a cloud platform to provide some deep learning services. This cloud platform could support users to upload data using GCS, AWS, and providing a data analysis report. Except that, I also did some work about developing SDK of this platform, the SDK has strict requirements on code style. So this experience cultivate my good programming habits and code style.

My second internship I had is in Microsoft, I did some work about big data, such as performace comparation between Spark and Our own Big data computing engine named ASA. I created some Some streaming data sets, and use Spark and ASA to process the streaming data, check the performance, analyze the reasons and find the optimization method.
